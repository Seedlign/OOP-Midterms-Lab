``` Methodology ``` : 
1.	```OOP Concepts```:
- How did you implement inheritance and encapsulation in this system?
- Why is it important to use these OOP principles in a real-world application like a student management system?
2.	```Array Usage```:
- Explain how you used two-dimensional arrays in your program.
- What is the benefit of using a 2D array to store the marks of multiple students across multiple subjects?
3.	```Input Validation```:
- How does your program ensure that all marks entered are valid (i.e., between 0 and 100)?
- What would happen if invalid marks were entered, and how did you handle such cases?
4.	```Method Design```:
- Which methods in your Student class are responsible for calculating averages and updating marks?
- How did you ensure that your methods are logically divided and easy to follow?
